# How to Program

A hobby project.

# TODO LIST

## IMPORTANT

1. Actually make the TextMorph component work
    * Somehow make the CSS work properly when thrown in a component. The spans need to be on top of each other.
    * Make the text look less blurry because of the svg filter
2. Make page transitions work for pages with Tres.JS
3. More pages, more content (Canaan!!!)
